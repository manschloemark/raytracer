Homebrew RayTracer

Bugs:
  ☐ Subsampling does not render the first part of the canvas properly.
  ☐ Something mega fucked with the Subsampling now.
    ☐ I suspect it's related to me fixing a bug from TraceRay - previously, the function returned without setting lastHit and currentHit when it hit nothing or a bounding sphere.
    ☐ Translucent spheres are the most messed up

Graphics Code:
  ☐ Clean up BoundingSphere code
    ☐ Make 'updateBoundingSpheres' instead when you already have some spheres.
  ✔ Improve subsampling - can I generalize it to be N pixel subsampling? @done(21-02-22 19:22)
    ✔ Impemented n-pixel subsampling along the y-axis. @done(21-02-22 19:23)
      ☐ Make it so subsampling gets progressively more detailed when the pixels differ
        ☐ Like when pixel 5 and pixel 10 are different, don't just render all pixels in between.
          - try rendering 6 and 9 and see if those are different. Keep doing that until you get two
          - identical pixels or until the uppper and lower pixel are the same pixel.
          ☐ This might be pointless because it would probably be slower.
            - but maybe it's good for higher subsampling
    ☐ Maybe I can implement it along the x-axis as well?
  ☐ Translucent Shapes
  ☐ Outline Shapes
    ✔ Outline Bounding Spheres @done(21-02-25 14:06)
      - A lot of missing pixels but it works.
  ✔ Add a function / something that generates a background color instead of using @started(21-02-23 21:29) @done(21-02-23 21:44) @lasted(15m24s)
    - a static hard-coded one.
    ☐ Play around with this kind of stuff more
  ☐ Texture Coordinates ? (From Scratch A Pixel)
    ☐ I don't really know much about the geometry of this but it sounds really neat. Would like to learn about it.

I/O:
  ☐ Read scene details from a file
    ☐ Export to file
  ☐ Read textures from images and apply to spheres

U.I. Code:
  ☐ Re-implement key-binds to move the camera @started(21-02-24 11:43)
    ✔ WASD @done(21-02-24 11:43)
    ✔ Z-Axis movement @done(21-02-24 11:43)
    ✔ Zoom @done(21-02-24 11:43)
    - Just copy-pasted them for now. Maybe I'll clean it up later.
  ✔ Make DOM module that takes care of all ui. @done(21-02-26 21:07)
    ✔ Keeps inputs up to date @done(21-02-26 21:07)
    ☐ Has extra goodies like render time
    ☐ Encapsulates all DOM code to keep things organized.
    ✔ Improve inputs so they always show current values and let you change them @done(21-02-26 21:07)
  ☐ I'm adding a bunch of dom elements for controls but I probably won't be able to implement them before work.
    ✔ Canvas width and height @done(21-02-26 21:07)
    ☐ Scene info
      ☐ Div containing spheres and all their info
        ☐ Maybe make a factory so I can have neat widgets for every sphere
    ☐ Lighting div
      ✔ Reflection Limit @done(21-02-26 21:07)
      ☐ Div containing all of the lights, just like the spheres.
    ✔ Camera div @done(21-02-26 21:07)
      ✔ Add camera position data to this div? @done(21-02-26 21:07)
  ☐ Maybe this is a good opportunity to practice using React? It seems like it fits nicely.
