Homebrew RayTracer

Graphics Code:
  ☐ Clean up BoundingSphere code
    ☐ Make 'updateBoundingSpheres' instead when you already have some spheres.
  ✔ Improve subsampling - can I generalize it to be N pixel subsampling? @done(21-02-22 19:22)
    ✔ Impemented n-pixel subsampling along the y-axis. @done(21-02-22 19:23)
    ☐ Maybe I can implement it along the x-axis as well?
  ☐ Translucent Shapes
  ☐ Outline Shapes
  ☐ New Shapes
    ☐ Render Triangles
    ☐ Render Lines
    ☐ Render Cubes
  ✔ Add a function / something that generates a background color instead of using @started(21-02-23 21:29) @done(21-02-23 21:44) @lasted(15m24s)
    - a static hard-coded one.
    ☐ Play around with this kind of stuff more

U.I. Code:
  ☐ Re-implement key-binds to move the camera @started(21-02-24 11:43)
    ✔ WASD @done(21-02-24 11:43)
    ✔ Z-Axis movement @done(21-02-24 11:43)
    ✔ Zoom @done(21-02-24 11:43)
    - Just copy-pasted them for now. Maybe I'll clean it up later.
  ☐ Make DOM module that takes care of all ui.
    ☐ Keeps inputs up to date
    ☐ Has extra goodies like render time
    ☐ Encapsulates all DOM code to keep things organized.
    ☐ Improve inputs so they always show current values and let you change them
  ☐ I'm adding a bunch of dom elements for controls but I probably won't be able to implement them before work.
    ☐ Canvas width and height
    ☐ Scene info
      ☐ Div containing spheres and all their info
        ☐ Maybe make a factory so I can have neat widgets for every sphere
    ☐ Lighting div
      ☐ Reflection Limit
      ☐ Div containing all of the lights, just like the spheres.
    ☐ Camera div
      ☐ Add camera position data to this div?
  ☐ Maybe this is a good opportunity to practice using React? It seems like it fits nicely.
