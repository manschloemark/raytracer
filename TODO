Graphics Code:
  ☐ Clean up BoundingSphere code
  ✔ Improve subsampling - can I generalize it to be N pixel subsampling? @done(21-02-22 19:22)
    ✔ Impemented n-pixel subsampling along the y-axis. @done(21-02-22 19:23)
    ☐ Maybe I can implement it along the x-axis as well?
  ☐ Translucent Shapes
  ☐ Outline Shapes
  ☐ New Shapes
    ☐ Render Triangles
    ☐ Render Lines
    ☐ Render Cubes
  ✔ Add a function / something that generates a background color instead of using @started(21-02-23 21:29) @done(21-02-23 21:44) @lasted(15m24s)
    - a static hard-coded one.
    ☐ Make this cooler!
